# Introduction
buildstation meetup is a simple meetup concept that is cost effective to run and has big marketing impact. buildstation hosts [ZxStim](https://zxstim.com/) and Paulus ([Dorahacks](https://dorahacks.io/) BD) have ran a weekly meetup series called BUIDL Station in Vietnam with over 50 sessions and created a vibrant and healthy builder community in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). This style of meetup is great for networking and for any ecosystem builders/developer relations/developer advocates to undertake.
