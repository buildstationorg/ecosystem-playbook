# Ecosystem Playbook
A playbook on how to build a thriving ecosystem of builders.

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of concepts, strategies and experiements that the buildstation core team and community have undertaken over the years. Feel free to use this as guideance for your. We only ask that if you used this playbook, please reach out to us for collaboration or give attribution to buildstation in your campaign. The community continuously innovates new things which will be updated in this repository over time.

## What this repository is not
This repository is freely available to everyone but it does not mean that buildstation is a marketing agency. The core team does not take marketing job requests, nor we are interested in doing so. We are a community of passionate developers that want to elevate the global hacker movement and shape the future of finance.
